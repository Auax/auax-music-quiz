# About

This project is a music quiz that allows users to select a premade playlist or use their own Spotify playlist to play. The project incorporates both client-side and server-side technologies, with the client-side built using create-react-app and the server-side built with Express.js.

The server-side of the project fetches songs from a Firebase database and uses the Spotify API to play them. Users can select a playlist and begin playing the songs, after which they must guess the name and artist of each song in the quiz.

The project also includes a scoring system that keeps track of the user's progress and provides feedback on correct and incorrect answers. The user's score is displayed at the end of the quiz.

Overall, this project provides an entertaining way for users to test their knowledge of music.
