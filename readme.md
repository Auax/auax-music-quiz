# Auax Music Quiz

This is a music quiz game which includes both the client and server.

The client is a `create-react-app` that requests the songs and music modes to the backend API, powered by `Express`.

All the modes are stored in a `Firestore Database`. The songs are fetched using the `Spotify web API`.

Development started around the following date: **2nd of April 2022**

## TODO:

* Add more modes
* Can't answer when the game is paused
* Song answer shows for less than a second (enough time though).
